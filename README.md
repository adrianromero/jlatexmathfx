# jlatexmathfx general Information
jlatexmathfx is a port of [jlatexmath](http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/jlatexmath/) to javafx

The control is usable but *not thoroughly* tested.

The performance has not been optimized but is acceptable on local tests. Upon first use initialization will happen but 
subsequent calls will be faster.
